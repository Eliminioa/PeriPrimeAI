The bot which allows Periwinkle_Prime to alert members of the Periwinkle community of an approaching battle.


USAGE:
Allows select generals to send mass communications to soldiers. Send a message to the bot with the subject line "SEND MESSAGE" entirely capitalized and without quotes. The body of the message will be what is sent out as a message. What you see in the message is what your soldiers will see, formatting and all. Use the prime_cnfg.txt file to set the user the bot logs in with, which side it filters for, and which users are authorized to send messages. Use the following format:

username,password,enemy's main subreddit name,recrtuitment thread id,General 1, General 2, General 3, etc 
**Note 1: obtain the thread id from the thread's URL. It's the 6-digit code .../comments/xxxxxx/title**
**Note 2: that there is no limit to the number of generals**

Example:
Peri_Prime,prime_password,orangered,206qef,Sahdee,RockdaleRooster,NaughtyPenguin
