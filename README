PERIWINKLE PRIME Mk2 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

The long term goal of this project is to give Periwinkle Prime the ability to hold a semi-meaningful conversation via comments and PMs throughout Chroma, in a chat-botesque manner. Obviously this is a long way off, but for now we're implementing additional, simpler features such as an alert functunality which will let Periwinkle generals send out mass PMs to warn of an upcoming battle.

Alert Bot Functionality:
The bot which allows Periwinkle_Prime to alert members of the Periwinkle community of an approaching battle.


USAGE:
Allows select generals to send mass communications to soldiers. Send a message to the bot with the subject line "SEND MESSAGE" entirely capitalized and without quotes. The body of the message will be what is sent out as a message. What you see in the message is what your soldiers will see, formatting and all. Use the prime_cnfg.txt file to set the user the bot logs in with, which side it filters for, and which users are authorized to send messages. Use the following format:

username,password,enemy's main subreddit name,recrtuitment thread id,General 1, General 2, General 3, etc 
**Note 1: obtain the thread id from the thread's URL. It's the 6-digit code .../comments/xxxxxx/title**
**Note 2: that there is no limit to the number of generals**

Example:
Peri_Prime,prime_password,orangered,206qef,Sahdee,RockdaleRooster,NaughtyPenguin
